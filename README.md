# trello-clone-dnd

I want you to create the app as similar as possible to the one shown in this screenshot. It's essentially a trello clone. It should have the ability to add new cards (tickets) in each column, have the ability to change order or of those tickets within a single column and even to move those cards between columns. Feel free to use pangea home dnd npmp package for drag and drop (i think that's the name, I might be wrong).
